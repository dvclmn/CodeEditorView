//  Created by Manuel M T Chakravarty on 10/01/2023.
//
//  This file defines the interface for external services (such as an LSP server) to provide language-specific
//  syntactic and semantic information to the code editor for a single file. It uses `Combine` for the asynchronous
//  communication between information providers and the code editor, where necessary.
//
//  An instance of a language service is specific to a single file. Hence, locations etc are always relative to the file
//  associated with the used language service.
